### About
The main objective is to emulate, using Netkit, a representative network of a small company.

This project has two parts:
  1. In the first part we will configure several computers, network devices and services such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), E-mail, Network Monitoring, Proxy, Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
  1. In the second part, the security of the ContaTudo network will be increased, limiting its access to the authorized elements and using safe services. To do so, ContaTudo will need to configure the Firewall service, use Secure Shell (SSH), use Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) in accessing your web page, restrict DNS and Proxy usage, and provide a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
